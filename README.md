# Financial-Modelling
Financial Modelling Projects in Excel.
This project is a basic financial model built in Microsoft Excel to estimate the intrinsic value per share of a company using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis method. The model provides a structured approach to forecast future free cash flows, apply a discount rate, and calculate the present value of a business.

The goal is to:
Help understand how to determine the fair value of a stock based on expected future performance
Applying core Excel functions to solve real-world finance problems
Interpreting financial forecasts in the context of investment decision-making
